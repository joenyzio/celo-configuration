/**
 * Use this file to configure your truffle project. It's seeded with some
 * common settings.
 *
 * More information about configuration can be found at:
 *
 * trufflesuite.com/docs/advanced/configuration
 *
 * You'll also need a mnemonic - the twelve word phrase the wallet uses to generate
 * public/private key pairs. If you're publishing your code to GitHub make sure you load this
 * phrase from a file you've .gitignored so it doesn't accidentally become public.
 *
 *
 *
 * Best practice is to decouple your settings from your codebase to increase security.
 * Use the settings below to decouple wallet works to a file called .secret
 * const fs = require('fs');
 * const mnemonic = fs.readFileSync(".secret").toString().trim();
